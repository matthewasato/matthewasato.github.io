      <a><i>Logos</i> is a company inspired by literature. Our love for stories and the adventures they take us on was the heart behind the start of this organization. We feel that the world has a need for more acessibility to print media. </a>
        <br>
        <a>The tangible experience of obtaining a physical work of writing has become a lost art, but we have come to restore it.</a>
        <br>
        <a>Here at <i>Logos</i>, we attempt to support aspiring authors through 3 simple steps:</a>
       <ol>
        <li>Inspire</li>
        <li>Educate</li>
        <li>Support</li>
      </ol>
      <a>Through the simple steps of our action plan, our mission is to provide the opportunity for every author to have the chance for their projects to see the finish line.</a>
