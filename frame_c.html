      <h2><u>Our Story</u></h2>
      <p style="font-family:verdana"><i>Logos</i> is a company inspired by literature. Our love for stories and the adventures they take us on was the heart behind the start of this organization. Here at <i>Logos</i>, we attempt to support aspiring authors through 3 simple steps:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>Inspire</li>
        <li>Educate</li>
        <li>Support</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <a>You can find many of our published books at the <a href = "https://wlaf.lib.in.us/" target = "_blank">West Lafayette Public Library</a></a>
